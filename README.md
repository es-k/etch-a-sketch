# [etch-a-sketch](https://gui-petry.github.io/etch-a-sketch/)

This project was suggested by [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project).

The idea behind it is to simulate an [Etch A Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch).

To draw, simply pass the mouse over the canvas. Each time the cursor moves over a particular square, it gets a darker shade of gray. The difficulty lies in the inability stop drawing until the cursor leaves the canvas.

I took no time or effort trying to make this responsive or touch friendly. It's mostly an exercise in DOM manipulation and event handling.
